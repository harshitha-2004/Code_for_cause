<p>lily, (genus Lilium), genus of 80 to 100 species of herbaceous flowering plants of the family Liliaceae,
     native to temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Many lilies are prized as ornamental plants, 
     and they have been extensively hybridized.
    The word lily is also used in the common names of many plants of other genera that resemble true lilies. 
    These include the daylily (Hemerocallis) and various species of the family Amaryllidaceae.

    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, 
        broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic;
         adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides.
          A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.

    <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable 
        for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, 
        such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat
         to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and 
         then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own.</p>

         <p>Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, 
            the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae 
            and the order Proboscidea. The order was formerly much more diverse during the Pleistocene, but most species became 
            extinct during the Late Pleistocene epoch. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, 
            large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive skin. </p>
